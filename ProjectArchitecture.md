Detailed Architecture Breakdown
1. Presentation Layer (Client-Side)
This is the user-facing part of the application.

Technology: React.js (for a dynamic Single Page Application) or EJS (for server-side rendering), styled with Tailwind CSS.

Components:

Web Application: The primary interface accessible via browsers.

Mobile App (Future): A potential native or cross-platform mobile application for better on-the-go access.

Function: Renders the user interface, captures user input, and displays data received from the server.

2. Application Layer (Server-Side)
The core server built with Node.js and Express.js. It's structured in a modular, MVC-like pattern.

API Routes & Controllers: Handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses. They define the endpoints for all operations (e.g., /api/auth/login, /api/properties).

Core Application Logic:

Authentication Middleware: Intercepts requests to verify user identity using sessions/tokens.

Session Management: Maintains user login state across multiple requests.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensures that Guests can only access guest features and Hosts can access host features.

Business Logic Modules: These are the heart of the application, each responsible for a specific domain:

User Module: Handles registration, login, profile management.

Property Module: Manages all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for property listings.

Booking Module: Processes property and ride bookings, checks availability, and manages booking status.

Ride-Sharing Module: Handles the creation, search, and booking of shared rides.

Search & Filter Module: Processes complex queries for properties and rides based on location, date, price, etc.

Payment Module: Orchestrates the payment process, interacting with the external payment gateway.

3. Services & Integration Layer
Handles communication with external third-party services.

Email Service (e.g., Nodemailer): Sends registration confirmations, booking receipts, and notifications.

Payment Gateway (e.g., Stripe): A secure, PCI-compliant service to process credit card and other payments. (Marked for Future Implementation)

File Upload Service (e.g., Cloudinary): Manages the upload, storage, and delivery of property and user profile images.

4. Data Access & Persistence Layers
Manages all data storage and retrieval.

Data Access Layer (Mongoose ODM): Provides a structured schema for the database, enforces data validation, and simplifies database interactions from Node.js.

Data Persistence Layer (MongoDB Atlas): The NoSQL database where all data is stored. The collections are:

Users, Properties, Rides, Bookings, Payments, Favorites, Reviews (as detailed in your document).

Detailed User Dashboard & System Flow
Guest / Traveler Journey
Landing/Login:

Unauthenticated user lands on the homepage.

Flow: User (Public) -> Authentication Module -> Login/Signup.

On Success: A session is created, and the user is redirected to their dashboard.

Guest Dashboard - Core Functions:

Search & Discover: Uses the Search Bar, which calls the Search & Filter Module.

View Details: Selecting a property/ride fetches details from the Property/Ride Module.

Book: Initiates a booking process handled by the Booking Module.

Pay: The Booking Module triggers the Payment Module to handle the transaction.

Manage: Viewing booking history or favorites involves queries to the Booking and Favorites collections.

Host / Driver Journey
Landing/Login: Same as the guest journey, but the system recognizes the role=Host.

Host Dashboard - Core Functions:

List a Property/Ride: The form data is sent to the Property Module/Ride Module and stored in the database.

Manage Listings: The host's view of their listings is a query to the database for items where hostId = currentUser._id.

Handle Requests: The View Booking Requests screen is powered by the Booking Module, which looks for bookings associated with the host's properties/rides.

Accept/Reject: This action updates the status field in the Booking Collection.

View Earnings/Withdraw: The Payment Module aggregates successful payments linked to the host and processes withdrawal requests.
